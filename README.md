# Linkit-smart-7688-Duo
Here are some applications modified and/or written from scratch for compatability 7688 Duo Microcontroller development board from Mediatek

This particular development board is essentially an Arduino Yun mini clone.   It has an Atmega CPU for your arduino stuff,
an SD mini slot for data storage and then a MPU running openWRS;  meaning that it is wiFi ready right out of the box!   

And its cheap!  usually under $20USD or $600NT (Taiwan).  
The perfect IoT board for small applications.

Basic specs:
MPU       MIPS 24KEc 580MHz 
MCU       ATmega32U4 8MHz 
Flash     32MB 
RAM       128MB 
WiFi      1T1R 802.11 b/g/n (2.4G) 
Ethernet  10/100Mbps
